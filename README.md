# PrincipalComponentAnalysis
A Multivariate Analysis problem could start out with a substantial number of correlated variables. 
Principal Component Analysis is a dimension-reduction tool that can be used advantageously in such situations. 
Principal component analysis aims at reducing a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the large set.
The technique of principal component analysis enables us to create and use a reduced set of variables, which are called principal factors.
A reduced set is much easier to analyze and interpret. To study a data set that results in the estimation of roughly 500 parameters may be difficult, but if we could reduce these to 5 it would certainly make our day. We will show in what follows how to achieve substantial dimension reduction.
